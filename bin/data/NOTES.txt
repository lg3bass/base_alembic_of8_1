-- Finally, Figured it out.  Hard Normals is the key!
vbo_4.abc

-- NOT WORKING. this mesh has the normals set to 50 degrees.  The mesh is splotchy.  Trying to find the minimum angle.
vbo_4b_normalAngle30.abc
-- Normal angle = 5 WORKS!
vbo_4b_normalAngle5.abc
-- Normal angle = 15 also WORKS!

NOTE: I've noticed that when normals are set to Hard the file size doubles as noted in the forums. 

vbo_4b_normalAngle15.abc
-- This is a test where I tried to set the -noNormals flag to false.  supposedly this will force write the normals.
vbo_4b_normalAngle50.abc 
-- Also tried simply "unlock Normals(polyNormalPerVertex)" . No Dice.
vbo_4b_polyNormalPerVertex.abc
-- OK, Normal Angle = 20 has some promising results. 
vbo_4b_normalAngle20.abc   <<--- THIS SEEMS TO BE THE MAGIC

-- Did a normal threshold test on vbo_1. Set to 25. No difference visual from vbo_1_test.abc.  a little more anti alised.
vbo_1_normalAngle25.abc

-- Smoothing tests:
-- Smooth level 2, Normal Angle=25. Crashes at time 1.5!
vbo_1_smooth_normalAngle25.abc

-- Smooth level 2, Normal Angle=20. Crashes at time 1.5!vbo_1_s2_n20.abc

-- Smooth level 1, Normal Angle=20, Runs ok
vbo_1_s1_n20.abc


-- Smooth 1, N=25, normals break. at beginning.  vbo_4c_s1_n25.abc
-- Here is that weird crash at 1.x time.
vbo_4c_s1_n20.abc

-- with nothing as a test.  Notice no normals.
vbo_4c_nothing.abc

-- with just setting the normal angle to 25.  HMMM. crashing?
vbo_4c_n25.abc

-- straight edges with setNormal.
vbo_2_tri_n25.abc

vbo_2_general_64_12-tri.abc

--shoot the moon.  Looking Good.  4mb though.:(
vbo_2_g64-12-quad-s25.abc

-- Like Candy, 3.4mb. Smoothed x2, general[32,4], normalAngle=25.
